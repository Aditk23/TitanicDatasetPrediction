# TitanicDatasetPrediction

This dataset is available on Kaggle Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster. Here we have to predict whether the passenger suvvived or not based on his/her data.

Brief overview of dataset :
											
survival : Survival ,									
pclass : Ticket class ,									
sex : Sex ,
Age : Age in years ,	
sibsp : # of siblings / spouses aboard the Titanic ,	
parch : # of parents / children aboard the Titanic ,	
ticket : Ticket number,
fare : Passenger fare ,	
cabin : Cabin number ,
embarked : Port of Embarkation ,							


Major Steps in project:

1)Reading dataset : Kaggle has provided 2 seperate csv files for train and test data.
2)Data Cleaning : Mainly dealt with missing values in this part.
3)Data Exploring : Visualizing data and selecting the features best suitable for accurate prediction (Feature engineering).
4)Model Building : In the provided notebook i have build model using 6 ML techniques namely Logistic Regression, SGD, SVM, KNN, Decision Tree and Random Forest.
5)Model Evaluation : Model is evaluated on all above techniques. Highest train accuracy was achieved by Random Forest Algorithm (89 %) and highest test accuracy was achieved by SVM model (78.708 %)
